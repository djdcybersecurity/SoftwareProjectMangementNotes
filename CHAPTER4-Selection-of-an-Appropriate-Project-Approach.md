# Selection of an Appropriates Project Approach

## **4.1 Intro**

- Choosing the right project approach is crucial for success.

- The decision depends on business goals, complexity, resources, and time constraints.

- Wrong approaches lead to delays, high costs, and project failure.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- For the healthcare IT software project, the approach needed to balance compliance (structured process) with rapid delivery (agile iterations).

<br />
<br />

---

## **4.2 Build or Buy?**

- Decision whether to develop in-house (build) or purchase an existing solution (buy).

- “Build” offers customization but requires more time and resources.

- “Buy” provides speed and cost savings but may lack flexibility.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- The hospital chose to build a custom solution to meet HIPAA compliance, rather than buying generic billing software that didn’t integrate with patient systems.

<br />
<br />

---


## **4.3 Choosing Methodologies and Technologies**

- Selecting methodologies (Agile, Waterfall, Spiral, etc.) shapes workflow.

- Technology choices (cloud, programming languages, frameworks) impact scalability.

- Decisions must align with project goals and organizational culture.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- The project team used Agile methodology with cloud hosting to support scalability across multiple clinics.


<br />
<br />

---

## **4.4 Choice of Process modules**

- Projects can combine different process models (hybrid approach).

- Process modules should fit project risk, scope, and delivery needs.

- Flexibility allows adopting best practices from multiple models.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- The project used Agile for development sprints but Waterfall for compliance documentation.


<br />
<br />

---

## **4.5 Structure Versus Speed of Delivery**

- Structured approaches reduce risks but may delay delivery.

- Faster approaches provide quicker value but may miss quality or compliance.

- Balance depends on stakeholder needs and project risk.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- The hospital wanted early results, so the scheduling module was released quickly, while security and compliance followed a structured review.

<br />
<br />

---


## **4.6 Waterfall Model**

- Sequential model: requirements → design → implementation → testing → deployment.

- Clear documentation and predictable outcomes.

- Risk: inflexible and costly if requirements change.


<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- Regulatory compliance documents for the healthcare software followed a Waterfall model because they required fixed, signed-off requirements.

<br />
<br />

---



## **4.7 The Spiral Model**

- Focuses on iterative development with strong risk analysis.

- Each loop = planning, risk evaluation, development, and testing.

- Best for large, complex, high-risk projects.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- The integration with hospital legacy systems was developed using a Spiral model due to uncertainty in compatibility.

<br />
<br />

---



## **4.8 Software Prototyping**

- Quickly builds a simplified version of the product.

- Helps stakeholders visualize and refine requirements.

- Reduces misunderstandings before full development.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- A prototype scheduling dashboard was built so doctors could provide feedback before full development.

<br />
<br />

---



## **4.10 Incremental Delivery**


- Project delivered in small, usable increments.

- Each increment provides working functionality.

- Useful for early feedback and reduced risk.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- The billing system was released in increments: Phase 1 (basic invoices), Phase 2 (insurance claims), Phase 3 (automated reports).


<br />
<br />

---

## **4.11 Agile Methods**

- Iterative and incremental development with frequent stakeholder collaboration.

- Responds well to changing requirements.

- Prioritizes working software over documentation.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- Agile sprints allowed the team to adjust features based on feedback from hospital staff.

<br />
<br />

---


## **4.12 Atern Dynamic Systems Development Method**

- Agile-based framework with strong focus on business involvement.

- Timeboxing ensures deadlines are met.

- Prioritization techniques (MoSCoW: Must, Should, Could, Won’t).

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- The hospital IT prioritized billing features as Must Haves, while cosmetic UI improvements were classified as Could Haves.

<br />
<br />

---


## **4.13 Extreme Programming**

- Agile method emphasizing frequent releases and high customer involvement.

- Practices include pair programming, continuous testing, and refactoring.

- Reduces defects and improves software quality.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

- Developers used pair programming to ensure high-quality code for patient data encryption.

<br />
<br />

---


## **4.14 Managing Iterative Processes**

- Requires balancing flexibility with structure.

- Continuous stakeholder feedback drives improvements.

- Risk of scope creep if not managed carefully.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

-Iterations of the scheduling module were managed with strict deadlines to avoid endless changes from doctors.

<br />
<br />

---


## **4.15 Selecting the Most Appropriate Process Model**

- No single model fits all projects.

- Choice depends on risk, complexity, compliance needs, and deadlines.

- Hybrid approaches often provide best results.

<br />
<br />


**Example:**

-The project used a hybrid model: Agile for development, Waterfall for compliance, and Prototyping for UI design.

<br />
<br />

---


## **CONCLUSION**

- Project success depends heavily on choosing the right approach.

- Each model has strengths and weaknesses.

- Hybrid approaches often work best in real-world complex environments.

- The healthcare IT project demonstrated the value of combining Agile speed with Waterfall structure for compliance.
