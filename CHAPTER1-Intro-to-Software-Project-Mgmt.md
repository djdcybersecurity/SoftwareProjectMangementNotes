# **CHAPTER 1: Introduction to Software Project Management**

---


## **1.2 Why is software project management important?**

- Software projects are often complex, costly, and time-consuming, requiring structured management to succeed.
<br />
- Good project management helps control costs, time, quality, and scope.
<br />
- It reduces risks of failure, such as missed deadlines or budget overruns.
<br />
- Ensures alignment between business goeals and technical outcomes.
<br />
<br />

## **EXAMPLE 1.2**

- OU Software Solutions might take on a project to build a **student tutoring scheduling app.**

- Without project management, deadlines slip, budgets overshoot, and features may not align with student needs.

- Proper project management ensures the team delivers a **working, useful app by finals week.**

<br />
<br />
<br />

## **1.3 What is a Project**
- A project is a temporary endeavor with a defined start and end, aimed at achieving specific objectives.
<br />

- Distinct from routine operations because it is **unique and goal-oriented.**
<br />

- Involves a set of activities that consume resources **(time, money, people)**
<br />

- Success is measured against scope, time, cost and quality constraints 

<br />
<br />
<br />

## **EXAMPLE 1.3**
- The tutoring app is a **temporary, one-time effort** with clear start/end dates.

- Unlike day-to-day support tasks, this project is unique and has defined deliverables (mobile + web app).

- **Success:** delivering a functional app to the OU tutoring center within the semester.

<br />
<br />
<br />

## **1.4 Software Proejcts VS. Other Types of Projects**

- Software is **intangible,** making progress harder to measure than physical projects
<br />
- High likelihood of changing requirements due to user feedback and business needs.
<br />
- More emphasis on creativity, problem-solving, and intellectual effort than physical labor.
<br />
- Greater risk scope creep compared to construction or engineering projects.

<br />
<br />

## **EXAMPLE 1.4**
- A construction project on campus (e.g., building a dorm) is visible and progress is obvious.
<br />
- In contrast, OU Software Solutions’ tutoring app is intangible — progress is code, not concrete.
<br />
- The app may face frequent requirement changes (e.g., students want calendar sync, then notifications

<br />
<br />

## **1.5 Contract Management and Technical project management**

- Contract management governs the legal and commercial side of projects
<br />
- Technical project manaement focusses on **planning,** **execution,** **and control** of software development.
<br />
- Both are independent - contracts define deliverables, while project management ensures delivery.
<br />
- Effective management balances business obligations with technical realities.
<br /> 

## **EXAMPLE 1.5**

- OU Software Solutions may sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the tutoring center.

- Contract management ensures clear deliverables (web app, mobile app, 3 months of support).

- Technical project management ensures coding, testing, and deployment are done on schedule.
<br />
<br />

---

## **1.6 Activities covered by software project management**

- **PLANNING:** Defining objectives, scope, schedules, and resources.
  
- **MONITORING & CONTROL:** Tracking progress, managing risks, and adjusting plans

- **TEAM MANAGEMENT:** Assigning roles, responsibilities, and coordinating collaboration.
  
- **DELIVERY & CLOSURE:** Ensuring acceptance of the final product and documenting lessons learned.

<br />
<br />

## **EXAMPLE 1.6**

- **Planning:** Define features (login, scheduling, notifications).

- **Monitoring:** Weekly team stand-ups to check progress.

- **Team management:** Assign frontend work to one group, backend/database to another.

- **Delivery & closure:** Hand over the app at semester end, with documentation.
<br />
<br />

---

## **1.7 PLans, Methods and Methodologies**

- **Plans** outline what will be done, when, and by whom.

- **Methods** are the techniques/tools used to complete tasks (e.g., Gantt charts, UML).

- **Methodologies** provide **structured frameworks** (e.g., Waterfall, Agile, PRINCE2).

- Consistency in methods/methodologies helps manage complexity and communication.
<br />
<br />
<br />


## **EXAMPLE 1.7**

- **Plan:** Finish backend by week 6, UI by week 8, testing in weeks 9–10.

- **Methods:** Use GitHub for version control, Trello for task tracking.

- **Methodology:** Follow an Agile approach with 2-week sprints.
<br />
<br />
<br />

---

## **1.9 Steakholders**

- **Stakeholders** include anyone affected by the project (users, managers, developers, clients).
<br />
- They have different, sometimes conflicting, interests and expectations.
<br />
- Effective stakeholder management is crucial for project acceptance and success.
<br />
- Communication and engagement reduce misunderstandings and resistance.
<br />
<br />

## **EXAMPLE 1.9**

- **Primary stakeholders:** OU tutoring center staff & students using the app.

- **Secondary stakeholders:** IT department (for hosting), OU Software Solutions team members.

- **Conflict example:** Tutors want simplicity, but IT may require extra security features.

<br />
<br />

## **1.10 Setting Objectives**

- Objectives should be clear, realistic, and measurable.
<br />
- Often defined in terms of cost, time, quality, and scope.
<br />
- Good objectives align with both business strategy and user needs.
<br />
- Helps create a shared understanding among stakeholders.
<br />
<br />

## ***USE **SMART** OBJECTIVES FRAMEWORK***

<br />
<br />

- **S-SPECIFIC**
    - Objectives must be clear, precise, and well-defined(not vague)

- **M-MEASURABLE**
    - Progress and success can be tracked using quantitative or gaulitative criteria

- **A-ACHIEVABLE**
    - Objective should be realistic, considering resource, time, and constraints.

- **R-RELEVANT**
    - Goals must align with overall business strategy and project purpose
- **T-TIME-BOUND**
    - Objective should have a defined deadline or timeframe for completion

<br />
<br />

## **EXAMPLE 1.10**

**Objective:** “Deliver a secure, reliable, and user-friendly scheduling app for OU students by end of semester.”

**SMART objectives example for this project:**

**S:** Provide appointment booking, cancellation, and reminders.

**M:** Achieve 95% uptime in the pilot phase.

**A:** Features limited to core scheduling in version 1.0.

**R:** Aligns with OU’s goal of supporting student success.

**T:** Delivery within 12 weeks.
<br />
<br />

## **1.11 The Business Case**
- Justifies **why** the project should be undertaken.
<br />
- Includes expected benefits, costs, risks, and alignment with business goals.
<br />
- Serves as the decision-making tool for project approval.
<br />
- Should be reviewed regularly to ensure continued relevance.
<br />
<br />
<br />

## **EXAMPLE 1.11**

- OU tutoring center struggles with manual scheduling → wasted time and missed sessions.

- The app will increase efficiency, improve student access to tutoring, and reduce admin costs.

- Business case justifies investing time & effort from OU Software Solutions.
<br />
<br />
<br />

## **1.12 Project Success and Failure**

- Success depends on meeting objectives for cost, time, quality, and scope.
<br />
- Failure can result from poor planning, weak management, or unclear requirements.
<br />
- Even "successful" projects may fail if they don’t deliver business value.
<br />
- Ongoing evaluation is needed to define success beyond just delivery.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## **EXAMPLE 1.12**

- **Success:** Students actively use the app during finals week, reducing no-shows by 30%.

- **Failure:** Delivering late or with poor usability, leading to low adoption.

- Even if delivered “on time,” failure could occur if students don’t use it.
<br />
<br />


---


## **Managment Control**

- Provides mechanisms to ensure the project stays on track.
<br />
- Includes setting baselines, monitoring performance, and correcting deviations.
<br />
- Control systems should balance flexibility with discipline.
<br />
- Essential for handling uncertainty and complexity in software projects.
<br />
<br />

---

## **Conclusion**

Software project management is vital for delivering value from complex, high-risk software projects.

Requires a blend of technical expertise, business awareness, and people management.

Clear objectives, stakeholder engagement, and strong control mechanisms improve chances of success.

The discipline underpins effective software delivery in today’s competitive environment.
