# An Overview of Project Planning

## **3.1 Introduction to Step Wise Project Planning**

- A structured framework that breaks down planning into sequential steps.

- Ensures clarity, consistency, and thoroughness in project preparation.

- Reduces risks by addressing objectives, scope, infrastructure, and resources early.

- Supports iterative review and adjustments throughout project life cycle.

<br />
<br />

**Example (Software Solution Project):**

- Step Wise planning was adopted to structure the development of the healthcare IT software. Each step (from scope definition to execution) provided checkpoints to ensure the solution aligned with organizational goals and available resources.

<br />
<br />

---

## **3.2 Step 0: Select Project**

- First step: identifying and justifying which project should be undertaken.

- Involves feasibility, alignment with strategy, and expected business value.

- Helps avoid wasting resources on low-priority or misaligned projects.


<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- The software solution project was selected because it addressed administrative inefficiencies in healthcare operations. Its strategic alignment with digital transformation and potential for cost savings justified selection.

<br />
<br />
----

## **3.3 Step 1: Identify Project Scope and Objectives**

- Defines project boundaries (what is included/excluded).

- Establishes measurable objectives for success.

- Aligns stakeholders on expectations to avoid scope creep.

<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- The scope of the software project included scheduling and billing functions but excluded clinical diagnostic tools. Objectives were defined: reduce admin workload by 30% and improve patient satisfaction scores.


<br />
<br />

---

## **3.4 Step 2: Identify Project Infrastructure**

- Determines organizational and technical setup needed.

- Includes identifying stakeholders, teams, tools, and governance structures.

- Lays the foundation for communication and decision-making.

<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- Project infrastructure included a cross-functional team (developers, healthcare consultants, IT support), GitHub Codespaces for development, and a governance board for oversight.


<br />
<br />

---

## **3.5 Step 3: Analyse Project Characteristics**

- Identifies complexity, dependencies, and constraints.

- Considers technical, regulatory, and organizational factors.

- Helps anticipate challenges that may influence planning.

<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- Key characteristics included regulatory compliance (HIPAA), integration with legacy hospital systems, and the need for scalability to handle multiple clinics.

<br />
<br />

---

## **3.6 Step 4: Identify Project Products and Activities**

- Defines deliverables (software modules, documentation, reports).

- Breaks down activities needed to produce each product.

- Provides clarity for task assignment and scheduling.

<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- Products included: billing module, scheduling interface, and admin dashboard. Activities included requirement gathering, coding, unit testing, and deployment.

<br />
<br />

---

## **3.7 Step 5: Estimate Effort for Each Activity**

- Estimates time, effort, and cost for each planned task.

- Often based on expert judgment, historical data, or estimation models.

- Provides input for scheduling and resource allocation.

### 5.1 Carry Out Bottom-Up Estimates
- Purpose: 
    - Estimate Staff effort, cost, and time for each activity
    - Work out elapsed time vs effort
    - Aggregate estimates for total for total project duration

- Key Points:
    - Effort = amount of work
    - Elapsed time = calendar time taken 
    - Bottom- Up ensures accuracy by considering individual tasks
    - Compare with top-down estimates for consistency

- make sure that you estimate effort based on expertise levels accross the team

- keep your team on board when discussing efforts to have realistic time estimations. This is based on realistic time measures.





<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- Developing the billing module was estimated at 6 weeks with 2 developers, while the scheduling module was estimated at 4 weeks with 1 developer.

<br />
<br />

---

## **3.8 Step 6: Identify activity risks**

- Identifies risks tied to specific activities (e.g., delays, skill gaps).

- Assesses likelihood and impact of risks.

- Develops mitigation strategies (training, contingency buffers).


<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- Integration testing posed a high risk due to dependency on hospital systems. To mitigate, a buffer of 2 weeks was added to the schedule.

<br />
<br />

---

## **3.9 Step 7: Allocate Resources**

- Assigns people, equipment, and budget to activities.

- Ensures optimal use of limited resources.

- Balances workload across the project team.

<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- The development team was split: two focused on backend APIs, one on UI, and one on database integration. Cloud hosting resources were reserved for testing and production.

<br />
<br />

---


## **3.10 Step 8: Review/Publicize Plan**

- Involves stakeholder review of the project plan.

- Ensures alignment and transparency before execution.

- Builds stakeholder confidence and commitment.


<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- The final project plan was shared with hospital administrators and IT staff. Their feedback on security requirements was incorporated before execution.

<br />
<br />

---


## **3.11 Step 9 and 10: Execute plan/lower levels of planning**

- **Step 9:** Begin execution, following the project plan.

- **Step 10:** Develop detailed plans for lower-level activities as needed.

- Ensures flexibility to adapt while maintaining structured oversight.

<br />
<br />

**Example:**

- Execution began with agile sprints for the billing module. Lower-level tasks, such as database schema optimization, were planned during development rather than upfront.

<br />
<br />

---


## **Conclusion**

- Step Wise planning ensures structured, phased preparation for projects.

- Each step reduces uncertainty and supports alignment with strategic objectives.

- Real-world use in the software solution project demonstrated how structured planning improves efficiency, stakeholder engagement, and risk management.
