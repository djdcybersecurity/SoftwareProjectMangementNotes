# Why is Software Efffort Estimation So Difficult?


## 1. Nature of Software 

- Software is complex and  intangible
- Requirements evolve and invisible dependencies often emerge.

## 2. Subjectivity in estimitation 

- Estimation often dpends on individual judgement and past experience
- This leads to overestimating small tasks and underesting large ones.

## 3. Organizational and political Factors

- Internal pressures can distort estimates.
- Different stakeholders may have conflicting goals - for  instance, management may push for lower cost estimates just  to get a  project approved.
